        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
          Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
          roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
          from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
          McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
          in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
          words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
          going through the cites of the word in classical
          literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
          Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
          Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
          by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
          first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
          comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
