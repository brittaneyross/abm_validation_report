CMAP is also developing a set of advanced models under the
"activity-based" modeling framework. This is a multi-year effort
outlined in our Strategic Plan for Advanced Modeling at CMAP.
Activity-Based Modeling is increasingly viewed as a superior method
to better understand the socioeconomic determinants of travel choice
and for evaluating modern transportation solutions. The research effort to
implement advanced models for metropolitan planning is still comparatively young
